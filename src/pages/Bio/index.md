Born in Miami, FL as a first generation immigrant. I was taught from a young age to always excel
and live my life to set the world on fire. I am currently a senior at Allegheny College pursuing
my Bachelors Degree in Computer Science while also getting a minor in Economics. After college I
am currently looking for positions having to do with Data Science, Financial Analytics, or software
consulting.
